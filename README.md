To work on the project you will need ot clone the repo.

Run NPM Install.


We are using a couple services for authentication, and cloud hosing for the images on the site. 
The site will not load localy until you add in the api keys for these services.

create a .env file at the root of the folder structure. then enter in the api keys.

To add your own api keys you will need to sign up for a cloudinary account at. https://cloudinary.com

And a Stormpath account and api key is needed as well. ~Temporary until Auth is redone~
